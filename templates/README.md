Currently, this folder only contains a list of commons based Templates that should be protected against creation on all wikis.
This file can be used by a git action (to be created) for protection runs.

Eventually, we might add the templates themselves to this repository though.
In that case the git action should be adjusted to use the Template files on the git instead of the provided list.
